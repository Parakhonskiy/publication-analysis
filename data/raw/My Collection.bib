abstract = {Image segmentation is one of the typical computer vision tasks that has received great success with the recent advance of deep-learning methods. However, it is still a challenging problem, particularly when encountering limited data. In this paper, we present a new strategy for particle image segmentation, which relies on extensive data augmentation methods to reuse the available annotated samples for more effective performance. The procedure consists of the K-nearest neighbour (KNN) matting to fine-tune manually annotated boundaries and the use of data augmentations to expand available annotated data. After that, we employ the U-net architecture to train the model based on a small dataset consisting of twenty images. The results showed that the proposed strategy could effectively extract particle boundary features, thereby obtaining accurate segmentation results based on a very limited source of images.},

abstract = {Particle assembly is a promising technique to create functional materials and devices from nanoscale building blocks. However, the control of particle arrangement and orientation is challenging and requires careful design of the assembly methods and conditions. In this study, the static and dynamic methods of particle assembly are reviewed, focusing on their applications in biomaterial sciences. Static methods rely on the equilibrium interactions between particles and substrates, such as electrostatic, magnetic, or capillary forces. Dynamic methods can be associated with the application of external stimuli, such as electric fields, magnetic fields, light, or sound, to manipulate the particles in a non-equilibrium state. This study discusses the advantages and limitations of such methods as well as nanoarchitectonic principles that guide the formation of desired structures and functions. It also highlights some examples of biomaterials and devices that have been fabricated by particle assembly, such as biosensors, drug delivery systems, tissue engineering scaffolds, and artificial organs. It concludes by outlining the future challenges and opportunities of particle assembly for biomaterial sciences. This review stands as a crucial guide for scholars and professionals in the field, fostering further investigation and innovation. It also highlights the necessity for continuous research to refine these methodologies and devise more efficient techniques for nanomaterial synthesis. The potential ramifications on healthcare and technology are substantial, with implications for drug delivery systems, diagnostic tools, disease treatments, energy storage, environmental science, and electronics.},

abstract = {Porous vaterite particles are regarded as promising candidates for drug-carrying system due to their good biocompatibility, degradability, physicochemical properties. However, different particle sizes can significantly affect their drug loading efficiency (LE) and release mechanism through adsorption-desorption mechanism. Herein, we successfully synthesized CaCO3 with high content of nanoscale vaterite at subzero temperatures. The results of six different sizes of vaterite in water, PBS, SBF and NaCl revealed that particle size and medium composition had important effects on its stability. The dissolution and recrystallization kinetics of the particles were explored through the time-dependent curves of pH and Ca2+ concentration induced by the particles in PBS and SBF solutions, which provided support for the drugs release mechanism. The LE of these vaterites for Rhodamine-6G and the release mechanism in PBS and SBF media were systematically studied, indicating that smaller vaterites had higher LE and faster drug release rate, which were attributed to their higher overall surface area and free energy, and the release model supported that the drug release not only depended on diffusion mechanism but was affected by self-dissolution and recrystallization. Furthermore, vaterite exhibited good cytocompatibility through the co-culture of particles and cells, and the cells showed stronger interaction behavior to small vaterites compare to larger vaterites.},

abstract = {Studying microplastics and nanoplastics (MNP) in environmental matrices is extremely challenging, and recent developments in labelling techniques may hold much promise to further our knowledge in this field. Here, we reviewed MNP labelling techniques and applications to provide the first systematic and in-depth insight into MNP labelling. We classified all labelling techniques for MNP into four main types (fluorescent, metal, stable isotope and radioisotope) and discussed per type the synthesis methods, detection methods, influencing factors, and the current and future applications and challenges. Direct labelling of environmental MNP with fluorescent dyes and metals enables simple visualisation and selective detection of MNP to improve detection efficiency. However, it is still an open question how to avoid co-labelling of non-plastic (i.e. non-target, matrix) materials. Labelling of MNP that are intentionally added in the environment may allow semi-automatic detection of MNP particles with high accuracy and sensitivity during studies on e.g. transport and degradation. The detection limit of labelled MNP largely depends on particle size and the type of matrix. Fluorescent labelling allows efficient detection of microplastics, whereas metal labelling is preferred for nanoplastics research due to a potentially higher sensitivity. A major challenge for fluorescent and metal labelling is to develop techniques that do not alter the inherent MNP properties or only do so minimally, in particular the surface properties. Stable and radioactive isotope labelling (13C and 14C, but also 15N, 2H) of the polymer itself allows to preserve inherent MNP properties, but have been largely ignored. Overall, labelling of MNP holds great promise for advancing our fundamental understanding of the behaviour of plastics, notably the smallest fractions, in the environment.},

abstract = {Biomaterials composed of food polysaccharides are of great interest for future biomedical applications due to their great biocompatibility, tunable mechanical properties, and complex architectural designs that play a crucial role in the modulation of cell adhesion and proliferation. In this work, a facile approach was designed to obtain novel 3D alginate-CaCO3 hybrid hydrogel particles in situ. Controlling the gel concentration from 3 to 20 mg{\textperiodcentered}mL−1 allows us to control the alginate-CaCO3 hydrogel particles' size and density (size variation from 1.86 to 2.34 mm and density from 1.22 to 1.29 mg/mm3). This variable also has a considerable influence on the mineralization process resulting in CaCO3 particles with varied sizes and amounts within the hydrogel beads. The measurements of Young's modulus showed that the inclusion of CaCO3 particles into the alginate hydrogel improved its mechanical properties, and Young's modulus of these hybrid hydrogel particles had a linear relationship with alginate content and hydrogel particle size. Cell experiments indicated that alginate-CaCO3 hybrid hydrogel particles can support osteoblastic cell proliferation and growth. In particular, the amount of hydroxyapatite deposition on the cell membrane significantly increased after the treatment of cells with hybrid hydrogel particles, up to 20-fold. This work offers a strategy for constructing inorganic particle-doped polysaccharide hybrid hydrogel scaffolds that provide the potential to support cell growth.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) extends rapidly in many research areas including design of novel processing routines, imaging, and material science. Particularly, ML enables design of new materials with complex structures and shorten the development cycle through model prediction from existing database. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) particles are regarded as promising candidates for drug delivery, biomedical, food, and industrial filler applications due to their good physicochemical properties and biocompatibility. However, a prerequisite for these applications is the production of particles with desired morphology, size, and phase compositions. Here, it is shown that the crystal growth and phase transition induced the transformation of spherical particles into spindle-like, square and needle-like morphologies with increasing temperature, and the increase of concentration increased this transition temperature. Furthermore, it is found that the concentration of the reacting salt solutions shifted the phase transition temperatures to higher values. Subsequently, ML is applied to precisely investigate and predict the polymorph formation of CaCO3 particles based on the experimental data obtained under 85 conditions, which would enable us to track crystallization trends, aiding in the identification of optimal conditions for generating monophase samples, and provide a feasible scheme for learning similar materials.},

The N-modified biochar contained N- and O-based groups (N–H, C–N, C≡N, O–H, and C–O), primarily consisted of mesopores (3.01 {\~{}} 14.42 nm pore diameter), and had a specific surface area ranging from 95.87 to 167.86 m2 g−1. The N-modified biochar's BPA adsorption capacity was correlated to the activation temperature (correlation coefficient n = 0.5), with adsorption capacities varying from 7.43 to 63.09 mg g−1. Ammonium chloride–modified biochar synthesized at 800 °C had over twice the BPA adsorption capacity of pristine biochar (28.80 mg g−1) among various nitrogen sources evaluated. The pseudo-second-order model characterized the adsorption kinetics of BPA, while the Freundlich model faithfully captured its isotherms. This study emphasizes the significance of proper nitrogen source selection and optimal modification temperatures to enhance the BPA adsorption capacity of biochar.

abstract = {Bio-based building products are considered key in our future socioeconomic environment, since they are a very relevant nature-based solution (NbS) to climate change. The statement of President von der Leyen (European commission) to turn the construction sector into a carbon sink is critical in this respect: bio-based materials should be used on a larger and more targeted scale in the future. The long-term use of materials is therefore very important since we need to improve the lifespan of renewable materials to increase its carbon sink potential. Hence wood is increasingly considered as a main building material. Service life aspects are critical in relation to the EU Construction Products Regulation (CPR). Traditional treatments to protect against fungal decay and the impact of fire are not always performing adequately and often environmental impact has been an important consideration. The option to enhance wood properties using innovative technologies can be combined with better definition of the expectations and requirements. Besides focusing on combined innovative treatments of the wood matrix, also envelope treatments similar to the use of coatings can be envisaged. This all should lead to an increased use of timber and engineered wood products for green building. This paper mainly focusses on the increased use and high potential of CLT (Cross Laminated Timber) and options to use hardwoods and modified wood (like TMT) in relation to moisture dynamics to come to fit-for-purpose material properties even under more hazardous circumstances.},

abstract = {This is the first comprehensive study of the impact of biodegradation on the structure, surface potential, mechanical and piezoelectric properties of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) scaffolds supplemented with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as well as cell behavior under static and dynamic mechanical conditions. There is no effect of the rGO addition up to 1.0 wt{\%} on the rate of enzymatic biodegradation of PHB scaffolds for 30 d. The biodegradation of scaffolds leads to the depolymerization of the amorphous phase, resulting in an increase in the degree of crystallinity. Because of more regular dipole order in the crystalline phase, surface potential of all fibers increases after the biodegradation, with a maximum (361 ± 5 mV) after the addition of 1 wt{\%} rGO into PHB as compared to pristine PHB fibers. By contrast, PHB-0.7rGO fibers manifest the strongest effective vertical (0.59 ± 0.03 pm V−1) and lateral (1.06 ± 0.02 pm V−1) piezoresponse owing to a greater presence of electroactive $\beta$-phase. In vitro assays involving primary human fibroblasts reveal equal biocompatibility and faster cell proliferation on PHB-0.7rGO scaffolds compared to pure PHB and nonpiezoelectric polycaprolactone scaffolds. Thus, the developed biodegradable PHB-rGO scaffolds with enhanced piezoresponse are promising for tissue-engineering applications.},

However, how mechanobiological properties of dead cells affect efferocytosis remains largely unknown. Here, it is reported that the Young's modulus of cancer cells undergoing ferroptosis is reduced. To modulate their Young's modulus a layer-by-layer (LbL) nanocoating is developed. Scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy confirm coating efficiency of ferroptotic cells while atomic force microscopy reveals encapsulation of the dead cells increases their Young's modulus dependent on the number of applied LbL layers which increases their efferocytosis by primary macrophages. This work demonstrates the crucial role of mechanobiology of dead cells in regulating their efferocytosis by macrophages which can be exploited for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases where modulation of efferocytosis can be potentially beneficial and for the design of drug delivery systems for cancer therapy.},

abstract = {Cancer is a serious health problem mainly characterized by unregulated cell divisions. It is known that malign cells display cancer-specific glycans that can be recognized by lectins, proteins with capacity of specific binding to carbohydrates. One such protein is the Dioclea violacea lectin (DVL), a known antiproliferative lectin that has been applied in this work to create and optimize a methodology for a controlled-release system by adsorption of lectin into CaCO3 particles. The system was tested by evaluating the cytotoxic effect of lectin particles against cervical cancer cells (HeLa) and compared to the non-conjugated lectin. DVL was adsorbed into CaCO3 particles of two sizes (average of 3.6 $\mu$m and 0.7 $\mu$m), a low-cost, biocompatible and biodegradable material, and the effect of DVL/bioconjugates against HeLa cells has been investigated in vitro and in silico. The bioconjugates possessed adsorption and release compatible with the biological assays. Cells assays applying the bioconjugates demonstrated their cytotoxicity, with a stronger effect compared to the free lectin. In conclusion, the anticancer potential of DVL against HeLa cells has been increased by the construction and application of a controlled-release system based on the adsorption of the lectin on CaCO3 particles with a relatively simple protocol. Also, the present data demonstrate the potential of lectin–particle bioconjugates as agents in cancer research and suggest an easy and low-cost methodology that can be extended to other lectins/proteins.

abstract = {Being extra strong but super easy to break – entities with such properties would be desired for many applications, particularly in drug delivery, where polyelectrolyte multilayer capsules took a prominent place due to applications in catalysis, intracellular delivery, and carriers of biomolecules and enzymes. Assembly of such capsules has been typically performed either by using polymers or a mixture of polymers and nanoparticles, which facilitated improvement of mechanical properties. In this work, we have assembled a new type of microcapsules, where multilayers are constructed solely by using nanoparticles in all layers. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies confirmed the dissolution of calcium carbonate, while mechanical properties of such capsules probed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) reveal an essential increase in the stiffness and density in the walls. Dual functionality of such new capsules has been achieved by actions of ultrasound and laser. Since ultrasound acts more effectively on denser objects, low intensity (below 1 W/cm2) of ultrasound has been used to enable release of encapsulated content. Laser has been used to illuminate microcapsules located in cells and effective killing of cancer cells was achieved. Further applications of the assembled microcapsules are expected in conducting catalytic reactions and biomedicine.},

abstract = {Because free therapeutic drug molecules often have adverse effects on normal tissues, deliver scanty drug concentrations and exhibit a potentially low efficacy at pathological sites, various drug carriers have been developed for preclinical and clinical trials. Their physicochemical and toxicological properties are the subject of extensive research. Inorganic calcium carbonate particles are promising candidates as drug delivery carriers owning to their hardness, porous internal structure, high surface area, distinctive pH-sensitivity, low degradability, etc, while soft organic alginate hydrogels are also widely used because of their special advantages such as a high hydration, bio-adhesiveness, and non-antigenicity. Here, we review these two distinct substances as well as hybrid structures encompassing both types of carriers. Methods of their synthesis, fundamental properties and mechanisms of formation, and their respective applications are described. Furthermore, we summarize and compare similarities versus differences taking into account unique advantages and disadvantages of these drug delivery carriers. Moreover, rational combination of both carrier types due to their performance complementarity (yin-{\&}yang properties: in general, yin is referred to for definiteness as hard, and yang is broadly taken as soft) is proposed to be used in the so-called hybrid carriers endowing them with even more advanced properties envisioned to be attractive for designing new drug delivery systems.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Japan Radiation Research Society and Japanese Society for Radiation Oncology. Early laryngeal, especially glottic, cancer is a good candidate for radiotherapy because obvious early symptoms (e.g. hoarseness) make earlier treatment possible and with highly successful localize d control. This type of cancer is also a good model for exploring the basic principles of radiation oncology and several key findings (e.g. dose, fractionation, field size, patient fixation, and overall treatment time) have been noted. For example, unintended poor outcomes have been reported during transition from 60 Cobalt to linear accelerator installation in the 1960s, with usage of higher energy photons causing poor dose distribution. In addition, shell fixation made precise dose delivery possible, but simultaneously elevated toxicity if a larger treatment field was necessary. Of particular interest to the radiation therapy community was altered fractionation gain as a way to improve local tumor control and survival rate. Unfortunately, this interest ceased with advancements in chemotherapeutic agents because alternate fractionation could not improve outcomes in chemoradiotherapy settings. At present, no form of acceleration can potentially compensate fully for the lack of concurrent chemotherapy. In addition, the substantial workload associated with this technique made it difficult to add extra fractionation routinely in busy clinical hospitals. Hypofractionation, on the other hand, uses a larger single fractionation dose (2-3 Gy), making it a reasonable and attractive option for T1-T2 early glottic cancer because it can improve local control without the additional workload. Recently, Japan Clinical Oncology Group study 0701 reprised its role in early T1-T2 glottic cancer research, demonstrating that this strategy could be an optional standard therapy. Herein, we review radiotherapy history from 60 Cobalt to modern linear accelerator, with special focus on the role of alternate fractionation.},

In this study, recombinant OsRIP1, a type 1 RIP from rice (Oryza sativa L.), was investigated for its anti-proliferative properties. Human cervical cancer HeLa cells were incubated in the presence of OsRIP1 for 24-72 h. OsRIP1 treatment yielded an anti-proliferation response of the HeLa cells and resulted in apoptotic-like blebbing of the plasma membrane without causing DNA fragmentation. OsRIP1 labeled with FITC accumulated at the cell surface. Pull-down assays identified ASPP1 (Apoptosis-Stimulating Protein of p53 1) and IFITM3 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3) as potential interaction partners for OsRIP1. Transcript levels for several critical genes related to different signaling pathways were quantified by RT-qPCR. OsRIP1 provoked HeLa cells to undergo caspase-independent cell death, associated with a significant transcriptional upregulation of the apoptotic gene PUMA, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and the autophagy-related marker LC3. No changes in caspase activities were observed. Together, these data suggest that apoptotic-like events were involved in OsRIP1-driven caspase-independent cell death that might trigger the IRF1 signaling pathway and LC3-mediated autophagy.},

abstract = {In current orthopedic practice, bone implants used to‐date often exhibit poor osteointegration, impaired osteogenesis, and, eventually, implant failure. Actively pursued strategies for tissue engineering could overcome these shortcomings by developing new hybrid materials with bioinspired structure and enhanced regenerative potential. In this study, the osteogenic and therapeutic potential of bioactive vaterite is investigated as a functional component of a fibrous polymeric scaffold for bone regeneration. Hybrid two‐layered polycaprolactone scaffolds coated with vaterite (PCL/CaCO 3 ) are studied during their 28‐days implantation period in a rat femur defect. After this period, the study of tissue formation in the defected area is performed by the histological study of femur cross‐sections. Immobilization of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) into PCL/CaCO 3 scaffolds accelerates new bone tissue formation and defect repair. PCL/CaCO 3 and PCL/CaCO 3 /ALP scaffolds reveal 37.3{\%} and 62.9{\%} areas, respectively, filled with newly formed bone tissue in cross‐sections compared to unmineralized PCL scaffold (17.5{\%}). Bone turnover markers are monitored on the 7th and 28th days after implantation and reveal an increase of osteocalcin level for both PCL/CaCO 3 and PCL/CaCO 3 /ALP compared with PCL indicating the activation of osteogenesis. These findings indicate that vaterite, as an osteoconductive component of polymeric scaffolds, promotes osteogenesis, supports angiogenesis, and facilitates bone defect repair.},

abstract = {Nanofibrillar structures are of importance in biomedicine, including lung, cardiovascular, liver, skin, neuroscience research, and tissue engineering. Developing advanced materials and interfaces should contribute to uncovering the mechanisms of diseases aiming to find cure. The similarity between the extracellular matrix (ECM) of soft tissue and hydrogels, characterized by a high water‐content viscoelastic polymeric fiber, has stimulated the development of hydrogels for biomedical applications. However, most hydrogels have a meshy structure resulting in poor cell adhesion properties. Here, fabrication of gellan gum (GG) hydrogels arranged by thermally driven self‐assembly into a network of nanofibers is reported. Mechanical properties of such nanofibrillar hydrogels are analyzed on micro‐ and macroscales. As a result, and in sharp contrast to commonly produced meshy GG hydrogels, the nanofiber‐based hydrogels facilitate the adherence and lead to proliferation of cells. This is assigned to microstructural rearrangements characterized by a changing density and pore size decrease, accompanied with a lower water content. Cell growth on such nanofibrillar structures is investigated for osteoblasts, which are chosen as a model system. The developed nanofibrous interfaces in this study are envisioned to be applicable for growing various types of cells and they should contribute to better understanding cell interactions with ECM.},

abstract = {Piezoelectricity is considered to be one of the key functionalities in biomaterials to boost bone tissue regeneration, however, integrating biocompatibility, biodegradability and 3D structure with pronounced piezoresponse remains a material challenge. Herein, novel hybrid biocompatible 3D scaffolds based on biodegradable poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) flakes have been developed. Nanoscale insights revealed a more homogenous distribution and superior surface potential values of PHB fibers (33 ± 29 mV) with increasing rGO content up to 1.0 wt{\%} (314 ± 31 mV). The maximum effective piezoresponse was detected at 0.7 wt{\%} rGO content, demonstrating 2.5 and 1.7 times higher out-of-plane and in-plane values, respectively, than that for pure PHB fibers. The rGO addition led to enhanced zigzag chain formation between paired lamellae in PHB fibers. In contrast, a further increase in rGO content reduced the $\alpha$-crystal size and prevented zigzag chain conformation. A corresponding model explaining structural and molecular changes caused by rGO addition in electrospun PHB fibers is proposed. In addition, finite element analysis revealed a negligible vertical piezoresponse compared to lateral piezoresponse in uniaxially oriented PHB fibers based on $\alpha$-phase (P212121 space group). Thus, the present study demonstrates promising results for the development of biodegradable hybrid 3D scaffolds with an enhanced piezoresponse for various tissue engineering applications.},

abstract = {Biodegradable piezoelectric 3D polymer scaffolds attract great attention due to possibilities to mimic the functional and mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix, avoiding secondary surgery, and electrically stimulated tissue repair. However, the preservation of piezoelectric response and improvement of wettability of hydrophobic fibrous polymer scaffolds, limiting their application in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, is a challenge. Here, a facile and mild approach is presented to improve wettability and cell spreading on the surface of piezoelectric polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and non-piezoelectric polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds. The surface of electrospun 3D fibrous scaffolds was modified by 3,4-dicarboxybenzenediazonium tosylate (ADT-(COOH)2) via photo-induced formation of aryl radicals under ultraviolet irradiation. According to scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction analyses, the intrinsic structure of 3D scaffolds remains unaffected after the treatment. Meanwhile, the attachment of hydrophilic 3,4-dicaboxyphenyl groups to the surface led to an apparent decrease of the water contact angle from 127±4° to 82±1° for PCL and from 126±4° to 78±2° for PHB, i.e. resulting in the change of the scaffold's wettability from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. Furthermore, no aging of the improved wetting was observed for 21 days. The diazonium modification allows to preserve a pronounced piezoelectric response, since PHB scaffolds demonstrate a slightly reduced effective d33 from 2.5 ± 0.3 pC•N−1 to 2.1 ± 0.4 pC•N−1 and surface electric potential from 510±56 mV to 458±25 mV after surface treatment. At the same time, after C6H3-(COOH)2 grafting, osteoblastic cells were well-spread along the PCL and PHB fibrous scaffolds. Moreover, after 7 days of incubation, the cell density is increased on the surface of ADT-(COOH)2-treated fibers in comparison to that on pristine ones, while cells formed a distinct osteoblastic network.},

A refined way of synthesis and modification allows preparing the enzyme delivery system with functionalized protection layers. The particles are characterized by electron microscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, and enzyme activity measurements. Loading efficiency and loading capacity are investigated depending on particle size, time of enzyme loading, and various container compositions and enzyme concentrations. Our results reveal that the size of particles influences their morphology, and this, in turn, affects the activity of the encapsulated enzymes. Various functionalizations of the surfaces including protection by the hydrogel layer, formation of hollow silver alginate, or calcium alginate encapsulation decrease the enzymatic activity. The presence of good therapeutic effect on osteoblastic cells coupled with a relatively high loading capacity, biocompatibility, and ease of fabrication suggests that the developed carriers are promising candidates for efficient drug delivery, especially in the field of bone reconstruction.},

In this study, ALP-loaded gellan gum (GG) hydrogels were enriched with gallotannins, a subclass of polyphenols. Five preparations were compared, namely three tannic acids of differing molecular weight (MW), pentagalloyl glucose (PGG), and a gallotannin-rich extract from mango kernel (Mangifera indica L.). Certain gallotannin preparations promoted mineralization to a greater degree than others. The various gallotannin preparations bound differently to ALP and influenced the size of aggregates of ALP, which may be related to ability to promote mineralization. Human osteoblast-like Saos-2 cells grew in eluate from mineralized hydrogels. Gallotannin incorporation impeded cell growth on hydrogels and did not impart antibacterial activity. In conclusion, gallotannin incorporation aided mineralization but reduced cytocompatibility.},

abstract = {Whey protein isolate (WPI) is a by-product from the production of cheese and Greek yoghurt comprising $\beta$-lactoglobulin ($\beta$-lg) (75{\%}). Hydrogels can be produced from WPI solutions through heating; hydrogels can be sterilized by autoclaving. WPI hydrogels have shown cytocompatibility and ability to enhance proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone-forming cells. Hence, they have promise in the area of bone tissue regeneration. In contrast to commonly used ceramic minerals for bone regeneration, a major advantage of hydrogels is the ease of their modification by incorporating biologically active substances such as enzymes. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is the main inorganic component of the exoskeletons of marine invertebrates. Two polymorphs of CaCO3, calcite and aragonite, have shown the ability to promote bone regeneration. Other authors have reported that the addition of magnesium to inorganic phases has a beneficial effect on bone-forming cell growth. In this study, we employed a biomimetic, marine-inspired approach to mineralize WPI hydrogels with an inorganic phase consisting of CaCO3 (mainly calcite) and CaCO3 enriched with magnesium using the calcifying enzyme urease. The novelty of this study lies in both the enzymatic mineralization of WPI hydrogels and enrichment of the mineral with magnesium. Calcium was incorporated into the mineral formed to a greater extent than magnesium. Increasing the concentration of magnesium in the mineralization medium led to a reduction in the amount and crystallinity of the mineral formed. Biological studies revealed that mineralized and unmineralized hydrogels were not cytotoxic and promoted cell viability to comparable extents (approximately 74{\%} of standard tissue culture polystyrene). The presence of magnesium in the mineral formed had no adverse effect on cell viability. In short, WPI hydrogels, both unmineralized and mineralized with CaCO3 and magnesium-enriched CaCO3, show potential as biomaterials for bone regeneration.},

abstract = {In this review, materials based on polymers and hybrids possessing both organic and inorganic contents for repairing or facilitating cell growth in tissue engineering are discussed. Pure polymer based biomaterials are predominantly used to target soft tissues. Stipulated by possibilities of tuning the composition and concentration of their inorganic content, hybrid materials allow to mimic properties of various types of harder tissues. That leads to the concept of “one-matches-all” referring to materials possessing the same polymeric base, but different inorganic content to enable tissue growth and repair, proliferation of cells, and the formation of the ECM (extra cellular matrix). Furthermore, adding drug delivery carriers to coatings and scaffolds designed with such materials brings additional functionality by encapsulating active molecules, antibacterial agents, and growth factors. We discuss here materials and methods of their assembly from a general perspective together with their applications in various tissue engineering sub-areas: interstitial, connective, vascular, nervous, visceral and musculoskeletal tissues. The overall aims of this review are two-fold: (a) to describe the needs and opportunities in the field of bio-medicine, which should be useful for material scientists, and (b) to present capabilities and resources available in the area of materials, which should be of interest for biologists and medical doctors.},

The scaffolds consisted of electrospun polymeric matrix, modified with porous calcium carbonate (vaterite) coatings, were developed and studied. The subcutaneous implantation tests in vivo with white rats demonstrated the high degree of biocompatibility of vaterite-mineralized scaffolds. Moreover, the performed in vivo release of bioactive molecules, immobilized in mineral coating of scaffold, allowed to control the regeneration process in tissues in the implantation area. Also, the decoration of mineralized scaffold with silver nanoparticles exhibited the capability of exploiting these materials as effective substrates with providing surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for precise detection of low concentrations of analyte. In this way, developed scaffolds can be promising materials with enhanced functionality of tissue regeneration, in vivo drug release and detection for designing novel smart devices for biomedicine.},

abstract = {Objective: to estimate biocompatibility of matrices manufactured from polycaprolactone (PCL) and mineralized by vaterite (CaCO3) via studying local and systemic manifestations of inflammatory reaction in subcutaneous implantation tests on white rats. Material and Methods. The experiment was conducted on 40 rats divided into four groups of equal sizes: control, comparison (rats with imitation of implantation), negative control (rats with implanted non-biocompatible matrices) and experimental group, comprised of animals with implanted PCL/CaCO3-matrices. Local inflammatory manifestations were analyzed by morphological investigation of implantation area tissues. Systemic inflammatory manifestations were estimated via TNF-$\alpha$ and interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1) concentrations in blood serum by ELISA. Results. The changes in cellular population content demonstrated that, on day 21 after the implantation, the PCL/CaCO3-matrice was evenly colonized by fibroblast cells and afterwards vascularized. Such matrices did not cause intense inflammatory reaction observed in negative control animals. It was accompanied by systemic manifestations, such as statistically significant increase in TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-1 concentrations. Conclusion. Our data confirmed the biocompatibility of PLC/CaCO3-scaffolds, thus experimentally substantiating the potential for their use in tissue engineering.},

abstract = {Encapsulation of enzymes allows to preserve their biological activities in various environmental conditions, such as exposure to elevated temperature or to proteases. This is particularly relevant for in vivo applications, where proteases represent a severe obstacle to maintaining the activity of enzymes. Polyelectrolyte multilayer capsules are suitable for enzyme encapsulation, where CaCO 3 particles and temperature‐dependent capsule formation are the best templates and the most adequate method, respectively. In this work, these two areas are combined and, ALP (alkaline phosphatase), which is a robust and therapeutically relevant enzyme, is encapsulated into thermally shrunk polyelectrolyte multilayer (PDADMAC/PSS) 4 capsules templated on calcium carbonate particles (original average diameter: ≈3.5 µm). The activity of the encapsulated enzyme and the optimal temperature range for encapsulation are investigated. The enzymatic activity is almost four times higher upon encapsulation when the temperature range for encapsulation is situated just above the glass transition temperature (40 °C), while its optimal conditions are dictated, on the one hand, by the enzyme activity (better at lower temperatures) and, on the other hand, by the size and mechanical properties of capsules (better at higher temperatures).},

Therefore, the creation of new methods for intracellular gene delivery, particularly to hard-to-transfect, clinically relevant cell populations is a pressing issue. Here, we report on the design of a novel approach to format 50-150 nm calcium carbonate particles in the vaterite state and using them as a template for polymeric core-shell nanoparticles. We apply such core-shell nanoparticles as safe and efficient carriers for mRNA and pDNA. We prove that such nanocarriers are actively internalized by up to 99{\%} of primary T-lymphocytes and exert minimal toxicity with the viability of {\textgreater}90{\%}. We demonstrate that these nanocarriers mediate more efficient transfection compared with the standard electroporation method (90{\%} vs. 51{\%} for mRNA and 62{\%} vs. 39{\%} for plasmid DNA) in primary human T-lymphocytes as a model of the hard to transfect type that is widely used in gene and cell therapy approaches. Importantly, these polymeric nanocarriers can be used in serum containing basic culture medium without special conditions and equipment, thus having potential for being introduced in clinical development. As a result, we have provided proof-of-principle that our nanosized containers represent a promising universal non-viral platform for efficient and safe gene delivery.},

abstract = {Hybrid materials, or hybrids incorporating both organic and inorganic constituents, are emerging as a very potent and promising class of materials due to the diverse, but complementary nature of the properties inherent of these different classes of materials. The complementarity leads to a perfect synergy of properties of desired material and eventually an end-product. The diversity of resultant properties and materials used in the construction of hybrids, leads to a very broad range of application areas generated by engaging very different research communities. We provide here a general classification of hybrid materials, wherein organics-in-inorganics (inorganic materials modified by organic moieties) are distinguished from inorganics-in-organics (organic materials or matrices modified by inorganic constituents). In the former area, the surface functionalization of colloids is distinguished as a stand-alone sub-area. The latter area-functionalization of organic materials by inorganic additives-is the focus of the current review. Inorganic constituents, often in the form of small particles or structures, are made of minerals, clays, semiconductors, metals, carbons, and ceramics. They are shown to be incorporated into organic matrices, which can be distinguished as two classes: chemical and biological. Chemical organic matrices include coatings, vehicles and capsules assembled into: hydrogels, layer-by-layer assembly, polymer brushes, block co-polymers and other assemblies. Biological organic matrices encompass bio-molecules (lipids, polysaccharides, proteins and enzymes, and nucleic acids) as well as higher level organisms: cells, bacteria, and microorganisms. In addition to providing details of the above classification and analysis of the composition of hybrids, we also highlight some antagonistic yin-{\&}-yang properties of organic and inorganic materials, review applications and provide an outlook to emerging trends.},

abstract = {10.1021/acsami.9b04936Elaboration of novel biocomposites providing simultaneously both biodegradability and stimulated bone tissue repair is essential for regenerative medicine. In particular, piezoelectric biocomposites are attractive because of a possibility to electrically stimulate cell response. In the present study, novel CaCO3-mineralized piezoelectric biodegradable scaffolds based on two polymers, poly[(R)3-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB) and poly[3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate] (PHBV), are presented. Mineralization of the scaffold surface is carried out by the in situ synthesis of CaCO3 in the vaterite and calcite polymorphs using ultrasound (U/S). Comparative characterization of PHB and PHBV scaffolds demonstrated an impact of the porosity and surface charge on the mineralization in a dynamic mechanical system, as no essential distinction was observed in wettability, structure, and surface chemical compositions. A significantly higher (4.3 times) piezoelectric charge and a higher porosity (∼15{\%}) lead to a more homogenous},

abstract = {Mineralized hydrogels are increasingly gaining attention as biomaterials for bone regeneration. The most common mineralization strategy has been addition of preformed inorganic particles during hydrogel formation. This maintains injectability. One common form of bone cement is formed by mixing particles of the highly reactive calcium phosphate alpha-tricalcium phosphate ($\alpha$-TCP) with water to form hydroxyapatite (HA). The calcium ions released during this reaction can be exploited to crosslink anionic, calcium-binding polymers such as the polysaccharide gellan gum (GG) to induce hydrogel formation. In this study, three different amounts of $\alpha$-TCP particles were added to GG polymer solution to generate novel, injectable hydrogel-inorganic composites. Distribution of the inorganic phase in the hydrogel was studied by high resolution microcomputer tomography (µCT). Gelation occurred within 30 min. $\alpha$-TCP converted to HA. µCT revealed inhomogeneous distribution of the inorganic phase in the composites. These results demonstrate the potential of the composites as alternatives to traditional $\alpha$-TCP bone cement and pave the way for incorporation of biologically active substances and in vitro and in vivo testing. {\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The amounts of loaded nanoparticles or substances were adjusted by the number of freezing/thawing cycles. Our method afforded at least a three times higher loading of magnetite nanoparticles and a four times higher loading of protein for micron vaterite particles, in comparison with conventional methods such as adsorption and coprecipitation. The capsules loaded with magnetite nanoparticles by the freezing-induced loading method moved faster in a magnetic field gradient than did the capsules loaded by adsorption or coprecipitation. Our approach allows the preparation of multicomponent nanocomposite materials with designed properties such as remote control (e.g. via the application of an electromagnetic or acoustic field) and cargo unloading.

In vivo biocompatibility tests of PCL/CaCO3scaffolds were complemented with in vivo drug release study, where tannic acid (TA) was used as a model drug. Release of TA from the scaffolds was realized by recrystallization of the porous vaterite phase of calcium carbonate into the crystalline calcite. Cell colonization and tissue vascularization as well as transplantability of developed PCL/CaCO3+ TA scaffolds were observed. Detailed study of scaffold transformations during 21-day implantation period was followed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction studies before and after in vivo implantation. The presented results demonstrate that PCL/CaCO3scaffolds are attractive candidates for implants in bone regeneration and tissue engineering with a possibility of loading biologically active molecules and controlled release.},

abstract = {Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) has attracted scientific attention due to its essential role in both inorganic and bioorganic chemistry. Vaterite is the least thermodynamically stable CaCO 3 polymorph and has elicited great interest as an advanced biomaterial for tissue engineering, drug delivery, and a broad range of personal care products. Numerous methods of vaterite particle synthesis with different sizes and morphologies have highlighted the submicron porous particles of spherical or ellipsoidal shape as the most useful ones. In this regard, the current study is aimed at development of a reliable method for synthesis of such structures. Herein, submicron vaterite particles are synthesized by dropwise precipitation from saturated sodium carbonate and calcium chloride solutions in the presence of ethylene glycol while manipulating the concentration ratios of reagents. We demonstrate that our novel technique named " dropwise precipitation " leads to changing calcium concentrations in the reaction solution at each moment affecting the crystallization process. The proposed technique allows routine obtainment of vaterite particles of a required shape, either spherical or ellipsoidal, and a controlled size in the range from 0.4 to 2.7 $\mu$m and (0.4 × 0.7) to (0.7 × 1.1) $\mu$m, respectively. The key parameters influencing the size, shape, and percent of vaterite fraction for synthesized CaCO 3 particles are discussed. ■ INTRODUCTION Over the past century, calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) has been one of the most studied water insoluble salts because of its importance in many biomineralization, geochemistry, and industry processes. 1−3 CaCO 3 has at least three anhydrous polymorphs: smooth cubic-like calcite crystals, whisker-like aragonite, and porous vaterite crystals of varied shapes. 4 High porosity of vaterite polycrystalline determines the possibility of bioactive substance incorporation, 5 which makes such a form of CaCO 3 stand out among the other crystallographic modifica-tions concerning its application as a smart container for various personal care and biomedical applications. Recently, it was found that vaterite spheres can be used as a drug delivery system due to their biocompatibility and high drug loading capacity. 3,6−8 Incorporation of various pro-teins, 9−12 drugs, 4,7,13−15 and DNA 4 into these matrices was demonstrated and pointed out the possibility of therapeutic effectiveness improvement for the loaded substance. These studies have raised the scientific interest toward the develop-ment of reproducible vaterite fabrication techniques decreasing the size of formed particles offering the opportunities of their application in drug encapsulation and delivery. Furthermore, the modern nanothechnological experimental methods together with possibility of the computer simulation allow the investigation of crystal growth process elucidating the formation mechanism of vaterite, calcite, and aragonite polymorphs.},

abstract = {The process of porous calcium carbonate (CaCO3 ) covering on electrospun poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone) (PCL) fibers is described in this study. Uniform CaCO3 coatings, composed of vaterite microparticles and its aggregates, were formed on PCL fibers by mineral precipitation from solution under ultrasonic treatment. The porous structure of CaCO3 in vaterite polymorphic form is useful for loading of various substances (drugs and nanoparticles), and this property makes vaterite an appropriate material for design of drug delivery systems. Such mineralization was implemented in order to attain therapeutic and/or biological activity of tissue engineering scaffolds based on electrospun PCL, by means of CaCO3 coatings. Various structures and polymorphs of CaCO3 coatings were obtained by variation of growth conditions (time of fiber incubation in work solution, ultrasonic treatment of this system). Coating homogeneity, CaCO3 polymorphic form, morphology and CaCO3 mass can be controlled by number of successive stages of fibrous material treatment. Cytotoxicity tests showed that PCL fibers mineralized with CaCO3 did not release substances toxic for cells. SEM images of PCL/CaCO3 scaffolds cultured with cells demonstrate that scaffolds were supported cells adhesion and spreading. The presented results show the new technique of controlled PCL scaffold mineralization with vaterite, and an opportunity of using PCL/CaCO3 as scaffolds for tissue engineering.

abstract = {Hydrogels are popular materials for tissue regeneration. Incorporation of biologically active substances, e.g. enzymes, is straightforward. Hydrogel mineralization is desirable for bone regeneration. Here, hydrogels of Gellan Gum (GG), a biocompatible polysaccharide, were mineralized biomimetically with CaCO3 using a double enzymatic approach. The enzymes urease (U) and carbonic anhydrase (CA) were incorporated in GG hydrogels. Hydrogels were incubated in a mineralization solution containing U substrate (urea) and calcium ions. U converts urea to ammonia (which raises pH) and CO2. CA catalyses the reaction of CO2 with water to form HCO3−, which undergoes deprotonation to form CO32−, which react with Ca2+ to form insoluble CaCO3. All hydrogels containing U+CA were mineralized more with calcite and stiffer than hydrogels containing U. Mineralization with calcite promoted proliferation and spreading of osteoblast-like cells.},

Ultrasonically accomplished precipitation of calcium carbonate was demonstrated as a novel beneficial method for the formation of porous submicron vaterite particles with low dispersity, high mass yield, and the "scaling up" possibility. The effect of sonication on the size and crystallographic phase of formed particles was investigated by comparing this method with a magnetic stirring and non-stirring interfusion. By virtue of their porosity, vaterite particles allow the different substance incorporation. The loading properties of synthesized particles were demonstrated for high molecular weight substance (labeled protein), as well as for low molecular one (fluorescent dye). Such features open up perspectives of drug encapsulation and delivery for the vaterite submicron carriers.},

abstract = {The suitability of hydrogel biomaterials for bone regeneration can be improved by incorporation of an inorganic phase in particle form, thus maintaining hydrogel injectability. In this study, carbonate microparticles containing different amounts of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) were added to solutions of the anionic polysaccharide gellan gum (GG) to crosslink GG by release of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) from microparticles and thereby induce formation of hydrogel-microparticle composites. It was hypothesized that increasing Mg content of microparticles would promote GG hydrogel formation. The effect of Mg incorporation on cytocompatibility and cell growth was also studied. Microparticles were formed by mixing Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) and [Formula: see text] ions in varying concentrations. Microparticles were characterized physiochemically and subsequently mixed with GG solution to form hydrogel-microparticle composites. The elemental Ca:Mg ratio in the mineral formed was similar to the Ca:Mg ratio of the ions added. In the absence of Mg, vaterite was formed. At low Mg content, magnesian calcite was formed. Increasing the Mg content further caused formation of amorphous mineral. Microparticles of vaterite and magnesium calcite did not induce GG hydrogel formation, but addition of Mg-richer amorphous microparticles induced gelation within 20 min. Microparticles were dispersed homogeneously in hydrogels. MG-63 osteoblast-like cells were cultured in eluate from hydrogel-microparticle composites and on the composites themselves. All composites were cytocompatible. Cell growth was highest on composites containing particles with an equimolar Ca:Mg ratio. In summary, carbonate microparticles containing a sufficient amount of Mg induced GG hydrogel formation, resulting in injectable, cytocompatible hydrogel-microparticle composites.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society. The use of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is limited by low reproducibility and uniformity of the response. Solving these problems can turn the laboratory use of SERS into real-world application. In this regard, soft SERS-active substrates can enable portable instrumentation and reduce costs in the fabrication of SERS-based sensors. Here, plasmonic free-standing films made of biocompatible chitosan nanofibers and gold nanoparticles are engineered by a simple protocol varying the concentration of chloroauric acid. The concentration and distribution of gold nanoparticles in films are controlled in a predictable way, and SERS spectra for the standard 2-naphthalenethiol with concentration less than 10-15 M are acquired in a reproducible way. The statistical analysis reveals a relatively high and locally uniform performance of SERS with an enhancement factor of 2 × 105 for 86{\%} of the points on the imaged area of the SERS substrate. Potential SERS detection of small molecules, both Rhodamine 6G and d-Glucose, in the micromolar range is demonstrated.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society. We present electrochemically controlled synthesis of polypyrrole microcontainers on electrogenerated hydrogen gas bubbles acting as a template. We performed structural characterization of the obtained microcontainers to gain insight into the growth kinetics of the polypyrrole shell. Experimental results showed that surfactant-mediated polymerization of pyrrole at the hydrogen microbubble surface under controlled electrochemical biasing led to the synthesis of various micro/nanostructures. Dependent upon the electrochemical conditions, such as the number of redox cycles and scan rate, the containers with spherical globules and bowl-like structures, which become lantern-like with increasing the number of cycles, are formed, as revealed by scanning electron microscopy. Their diameter can range between 40 and 200 $\mu$m, and wall thickness can be varied from 2 to 70 $\mu$m, depending upon the electropolymerization conditions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society. Biocompatibility and high loading capacity of mesoporous CaCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} vaterite crystals give an option to utilize the polycrystals for a wide range of (bio)applications. Formation and transformations of calcium carbonate polymorphs have been studied for decades, aimed at both basic and applied research interests. Here, composite multilayer-coated calcium carbonate polycrystals containing Fe{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} magnetite nanoparticles and model protein lysozyme are fabricated. The structure of the composite polycrystals and vaterite → calcite recrystallization kinetics are studied. The recrystallization results in release of both loaded protein and Fe{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} nanoparticles (magnetic manipulation is thus lost). Fe{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} nanoparticles enhance the recrystallization that can be induced by reduction of the local pH with citric acid and reduction of the polycrystal crystallinity. Oppositely, the layer-by-layer assembled poly(allylamine hydrochloride)/poly(sodium styrenesulfonate) polyelectrolyte coating significantly inhibits the vaterite → calcite recrystallization (from hours to days) most likely due to suppression of the ion exchange giving an option to easily tune the release kinetics for a wide time scale, for example, for prolonged release. Moreover, the recrystallization of the coated crystals results in formulation of multilayer capsules keeping the feature of external manipulation. This study can help to design multifunctional microstructures with tailor-made characteristics for loading and controlled release as well as for external manipulation.},

Calcium carbonate particles (CaCO3) were recrystallized into HA beads in water solution with phosphate ions. The size of initial CaCO3 particles was controlled upon the synthesis by varying the amount of ethylene glycol (EG) in aqueous solution. The average size of HA beads ranged from 0.6±0.1 to 4.3±1.1$\mu$m. Silver nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of HA and CaCO3 particles via silver mirror reaction. Surface enhanced Raman scattering of silver functionalized beads was demonstrated by detecting Rhodamine B. CaCO3 and HA particles have a great potential for design of carrier which can provide diagnostic and therapeutic functions.},

Many of these principles were developed in the context of polymeric multilayer capsule membrane modulation, but they are also pertinent to liposomes, polymersomes, capsosomes, particles, emulsion-based carriers and other carriers. We look at these methods from the physical, chemical or biological driving mechanisms point of view. In addition to applicability for carriers in drug delivery, these release methods are significant for another area directly related to pharmacology-modulation of the permeability of the membranes and thus promoting the action of drugs. Emerging technologies, including ionic current monitoring through a lipid membrane on a nanopore, are also highlighted.},

abstract = {Colloidal particles play an important role in various areas of material and pharmaceutical sciences, biotechnology, and biomedicine. In this overview we describe micro- and nano-particles used for the preparation of polyelectrolyte multilayer capsules and as drug delivery vehicles. An essential feature of polyelectrolyte multilayer capsule preparations is the ability to adsorb polymeric layers onto colloidal particles or templates followed by dissolution of these templates. The choice of the template is determined by various physico-chemical conditions: solvent needed for dissolution, porosity, aggregation tendency, as well as release of materials from capsules. Historically, the first templates were based on melamine formaldehyde, later evolving towards more elaborate materials such as silica and calcium carbonate. Their advantages and disadvantages are discussed here in comparison to non-particulate templates such as red blood cells. Further steps in this area include development of anisotropic particles, which themselves can serve as delivery carriers. We provide insights into application of particles as drug delivery carriers in comparison to microcapsules templated on them.},

Experiments with two types of payloads, providing different molecular weights and zeta-potentials, demonstrate a flexible way of tailoring the payload delivery time via the molecular properties of the cargo. A dual in vitro cellular uptake experiment with human ovarian carcinoma cells ES2 and human fibroblasts MRC5 shows no cytotoxicity, no influence on cell viability, and fast penetration of substance-loaded containers into cells.

abstract = {In photodynamic therapy (PDT), photosensitizers are required to arrive in high concentrations at selective targets like cancer cells avoiding toxicity in healthy tissue. In this work, we propose the application of porous calcium carbonate carriers in the form of polycrystalline vaterite for this task. We investigated the loading efficiency for the photosensitizer Photosens in vaterite micro- and nanocarriers. A possible release mechanism depending on the surrounding pH was studied, showing a fast degradation of the carriers in buffers below pH7. These results hold out the prospect of a novel PDT drug delivery system. Variation of particle size or additional coatings allow custom-design of workload release curves. An intrinsic cancer-sensitivity can be expected from the pH-dependent release in the acidic microenvironment of cancer tissue.},

Polypyrrole surfaces with high redox current due to their increased surface area are obtained; for optimized conditions, also microcontainers are obtained. The polypyrrole microcontainers with a size of less than 20 microm can be easily detached from the electrode surface and polypyrrole films during several minutes of sonication in an ultrasonic bath.

The release of the encapsulated material under laser radiation makes these systems promising for use as microcontainers intended for the target delivery of drugs in an organism. {\textcopyright} Nauka/Interperiodica 2006.},

abstract = {Langmuir-Blodgett films with high X-ray contrast in between the neighboring bilayers are prepared using two-chamber Langmuir trough. These films consist of alternating bilayers of lead stearate and nickel stearate, lead stearate and copper stearate. Prepared samples do not contain free stearic acid as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and surface pressure isotherms. The superlattice structure with the unit cell size equaled to the sum of thicknesses of two bilayers in the direction perpendicular to the substrate was determined by X-ray analysis. It is shown that surface roughness is relatively small and the organization of bi- and tetra-layers is rather perfect.},
